description: >
    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
    three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five
    print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
    "FizzBuzz".
steps:
    - Iterate all the numbers from 1 to 100.
    - 'If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead'
    - 'If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead'
    - 'If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead'
